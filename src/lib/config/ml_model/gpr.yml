        value: false
        description: 'Whether to normalize the target values y by removing the mean and scaling to unit-variance. This is recommended for cases where zero-mean, unit-variance priors are used.'

        value: true
        description: 'If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored, which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified externally.'

        value: null
        description: 'The number of dimensions of the target values. Used to decide the number of outputs when sampling from the prior distributions (i.e. calling sample_y before fit). This parameter is ignored once fit has been called'
